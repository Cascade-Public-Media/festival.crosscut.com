Repo root contains frontend source.

`api` folder contains backend "api" elements.



**Front End**

Getting Started:

- Make sure Node.js is installed.
- Install gulp cli globally. `npm install -g gulp-cli`.
- Install dependencies. `npm install`.
- Get vendor files and run build.  `gulp init`.

Developing with BrowserSync:

- Run `gulp watch`. This starts a local mini-server, provides a URL to view the site (http://localhost:3000), and will open the URL in a browser automatically. BrowserSync reloads the page automatically when changes are saved.
